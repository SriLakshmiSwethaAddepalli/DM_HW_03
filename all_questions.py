Enhancing cohesion by lowering SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) inherently bolsters separation, evidenced by a rise in SSB (Sum of Squares Between clusters), due to the fact that SSE and SSB are components of the constant total sum of squares (TSS). This means that any improvement in cluster tightness or cohesion simultaneously leads to clearer delineation or separation among clusters."
